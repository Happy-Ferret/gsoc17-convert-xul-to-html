# gsoc-convert-xul-to-html
Dialog-boxes development area for GSoC-2017 project - `convert xul to html`

## Project Description
Lightning(Thunderbird calendar addon) has traditionally been using XUL for its user interface. To modernize, **I will be converting User Interface of some dialogs into React.** The new components will be using web standards as much as possible, avoiding extensive use of third party libraries. I will be using React.js for developing HTML. React.js is very good for making reusable web components and it is quite efficient as well. Unlike XUL, debugging is very easy with react.js. The components that I have picked to convert into react.js are **Print dialog box, Calendar Alarm dialog box and Event dialog box.**
